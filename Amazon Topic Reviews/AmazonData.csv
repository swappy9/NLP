1^1^These are hands down the best quality bands for the money^2016-01-16^false^ These are hands down the best quality bands for the money. I am a 38 year old male and wanted a resistance band set that I could travel with as well as use it at home with my p90 workouts. I specifically wanted bands that were made with high quality material and would not break after a few months. After months of research I pulled the trigger and bought Black Mountain resistance band set. These bands met all of my expectations and more. They are high quality and multiple bands can be combined for added resistance. The travel bag makes it easy to travel with since I am always on the go. My wife always really liked them and we ordered a second set to replace her flimsy less quality bands. Thanks Black Mountain for producing a great product at a fraction of what other competitors are selling them for.^5.00
1^2^High Quality Bands^2016-01-22^false^ I just got this set yesterday as well as a set from another company so I could compare the quality. The other set seems to be made pretty well, but these from Black Mountain are higher quality. The nylon webbing and hardware are heavier and have an overall better quality look. I\ve been using resistance bands for years. Not as my sole resistance routine, but to suppliment my exercise machines and free weights. Everyone that exercises should give bands a try if they haven\t as they are very effective. As these eventually wear out as they all do in time, I\ll replace them with Black Mountain products again. My only complaint is there is a slip of paper that came with the bands offering me a free orange band, but the phone number given doesn\t seem to connect to anything.^5.00
1^3^Five Stars^2015-12-27^false^ My husband uses these and finds them to be good for his arthritis stretching exercises^5.00
1^4^The resistance is great. I would agree that the low resistance is ...^2016-01-13^false^ I got these for Christmas and have been using them multiple days a week since. The resistance is great. I would agree that the low resistance is pretty worthless but maybe some use it?? I was a little skeptical about the customer service given the review but I called to inquire about these before purchase and they answered right away which gave me a little more confidence. So far so good, I will let you know if there are any issues with the bands themselves after continue usage between 3-4x/wk.^4.00
1^5^Good quality product^2016-01-20^false^ Haven\t had it long enough to use all of the components but so far I\m impressed with the quality of the material. I also really like the fact that you can remove and mix/match the bands using the hooks on each end. All in all, so far so good, and they do what they\re meant to do. Will update once I can try the other exercise positions using the door anchor.^5.00
1^6^Excellent product^2016-01-22^false^ I\m not a weight guy and I\ve tried resistance bands in the past and was never that impressed. This product is great. It doesn\t have that flimsy, cheap feel. It feels solid and offers good resistance and is easy to use. I\ve used it now for a while and I will keep on using it instead of throwing it in some drawer to gather dust. I would highly recommend this product for both beginners and veterans. And it is compact enough to take with me on trips^5.00
1^7^Really delivers!!^2016-01-18^false^ I love this product! Upon first receiving it I was skeptical that these would provide a good workout but I can assure you after doing a little 10 minute workout found on YouTube, these little bands deliver! I was so sore after just a short workout. I highly recommend this product to anyone considering a home exercise product to keep themselves fit.^5.00
1^8^Great Resistance bands^2016-01-25^false^ Excellent packaging. The whole set fits neatly into the carrying bag. Excellent for travel. The bands appear to be of superior quality when compared to SPRI. Connecters work well, as does the door mount. Stacking the bands is easy, and quality control has ensured that the bands are of consistent length. Awesome purchase.^5.00
1^9^Good stuff^2016-01-19^false^ Received these as a gift. Construction seems pretty legit. I like the Carabiners vice plastic clips of competitors. The handles and other attachment points feel quality. Perfect to stay on track while traveling and can\t take the weights with me. Would recommend this product and company to friends and family.^4.00
1^10^Love â?¤ the tension bands^2016-01-15^false^ Alot of bang ð??¥ for the buck. Effective work out without the hassles of changing weight and buying expensive equipment. Best of all you can take it with you when traveling. It comes with a carrying case and has an instruction manual which clearly shows the different exercises and how to set up what is needed.^5.00
1^11^Good for a light workout^2016-01-14^false^ Good for a light workout. It is very portable, gives you more variety of exercises you can do and takes up much less space then a set of dumbells. The bands are sturdy and the connections at the end are solid and seem well made. Overall a very good value as long as you aren\t looking for real heavy lifting.^4.00
1^12^Very happy with these bands^2016-01-20^false^ I purchased these bands to help re-strengthen after shoulder surgery, and have been very happy with them. Quality is excellent. It\s fast and easy to change the handles from one band to another, and the carry-bag has made it easy to take these with me wherever I might travel. Highly recommended.^5.00
1^13^They tore after a year^2016-01-20^false^ They tore up after a little over a year, and I\m not very strong... Poor quality, also one of the handle got bent (but you can still work out with it). When they tear it can be painful, so I suggest if you must buy this brand, replace every year.^1.00
1^14^Great for limited budget or space^2016-01-17^false^ these were perfect for my home gym. Easier to store and move than dumbbells, and significantly cheaper. The handles and door frame loop are advantages over traditional bands and make them feel more like gym machines than exercise bands.^5.00
1^15^Great Product^2016-01-13^false^ Great product , I don\t have time to go to the gym and this product is very good because I can take it anywhere. I just started using it with my P90X and it works very well. I\m happy with this product and would recommended to anyone.^5.00

1^20^Great for At-Home Physical Therapy Exercises^2016-01-11^false^ I have been using these bands for about 2 months and they are great. I had double shoulder and bicep surgery this year and these bands are perfect for my at home exercises prescribed by my physical therapists.^5.00

It is truly a well manufactured product. I think the price is right considering the level of excellent construction.I rarely give a 5 star but in this case they deserve it.^5.00
1^22^Great product!^2016-01-12^false^ Great product!! I love the fact that you can clip multiple bands together for increased resistance. They are great for a quick workout during a work break. Highly recommended...^5.00

2^63^Works great!^2016-01-09^false^ I bought this kit 2 winters ago. We have a ranch house on the side of a mountain and it gets very cold. Combine that with really crummy old windows and our house was freezing. Not good when you pay for home heating oil!!! It was so bad at one point that when it was windy outside, I actually witnessed the drapes in my house billowing into the room. That is when I decided to purchase this kit. I actually got 2 kits to make sure I could finish all the windows in my house, and I ended up having plenty left over. I installed the double sided tape and stuck on the plastic, used the blowdryer to warm it up and shrink wrap the windows, and I was done. No more draft or chilly rooms! You are supposed to take it off after each winter but I have left it on for 2 years now. I find it also keeps my house cooler in the summer. Combined with thermal drapes, you have a combination for energy savings. PROS: - sticks great and lasts for a long time -once you get the hang of it, its easy to install -really has saved us money on home heating oil CONS: - if you don\t totally shrink the plastic, you can see the ripples from the outside of the house and it looks a little messy, but if you do it right it is crystal clear -it is awfully hard to get the double stick tape off if you leave the product up for a long time We are now going into our third winter with the same kit on our windows and we are only now noticing some of the windows are losing their plastic in some places, peeling etc. But thats to be expected when its only supposed to be left on for a shorter period of time.^5.00
2^64^I\m saving a bunch of money on gas^2016-01-21^false^ My apartment has a front living room with three windows that let in very cold air in winter, so I moved my living room into the middle dining room. I keep the door between the two rooms open enough for my cats to get through. I rarely go in the front room in winter because it\s so cold. My friend helped me install this insulator, which turned out to be very easy. Just apply the double-sided tape around the frame, attach the plastic, and then blow dry with heat to tighten the plastic. I can barely even see the insulating plastic. The only problem is that I had to decide if I wanted the window blinds up or down, because the plastic covers the entire window casing. You will not be able to use your blinds or shades, just drapery. I\ve lived here in Erie, PA, seven years, and I\ve wasted so much money on gas. When I moved from the front room to the middle room and kept the door between the two ajar instead of wide open, I reduced my monthly gas budget from $98 to $72. Now that I have this product, my monthly amount is $42! Unbelievable!^5.00
2^65^Great product to save money & help comfort in home^2016-01-22^false^ This is a great product to prevent leaky windows from succeeding in letting cold air inside. The tape holds well when the outdoor wind blows. PLEASE READ: Exercise patience, measure TWICE before you cut the film and allow for an extra inch, don\t skimp or you will regret it (read: trying to pull too tight when mounting and risk not fitting or tear of film). Glad I bought one extra box to learn from mistakes and not have to wait /endure more cold. I like that visibility outside is not compromised^5.00
2^66^Amazing product, significanlty warms the room.^2016-01-18^false^ I love this product, we have an old house and a lot of leaks around the windows. This significantly changes the room temperature, it increased the warmth of the room significantly. It took us one window to figure out the technique for putting it into place and once we got the technique down it was very easy to put in place. Use the hair dryer at the end to tighten up the material and you are good to go. Will be using this for every winter from here on out for the cold Chicago winters.^5.00
2^67^Great Product^2016-01-19^false^ Great product, seals great and definitely makes a huge difference in temperature. My heat kicks on less often. Depending on window size, you can sometimes get more than 3 windows out of it! Most important step not to skip is making sure your window sill is CLEAN. If it\s not, the insulator tape is not going to stick, and cold air will seep in.^5.00
2^68^Will make you hate keeping room warm^2016-01-21^false^ What a waste of money, first off let me state that is product may work if you ever get it applied to he window. After multiple applications trying to center a giant sheet of Saran Wrap around super sticky tape I am probably qualified to fuel jets mid air. This product is beyond infuriating. Perhaps a team of 4 would have no issues.^1.00
2^69^Should have bought these a long time ago!^2016-01-20^false^ My brother installed these for me. He used a hot blower gun (sort of like a hair dryer) and it shrunk it so that I cannot even tell that there is plastic over my windows! Seriously, they are invisible. I can tell already that it will keep my daylight basement warmer :). I highly recommend this!^5.00
2^70^I immediately put this on my worst problem window and it\s made a big difference^2016-01-05^false^ Such a simple solution, and it really works. Older home, not able to afford fancy new windows. I immediately put this on my worst problem window and it\s made a big difference.^5.00
2^71^Keeps the temperature inside more consistent.^2016-01-17^false^ Helped keep the room much warmer. My girlfriends room is above the garage so we insulated the windows to cut down on the cold air getting in. It definitely helped.^5.00
2^72^Super easy to use- never needed to use a window ...^2016-01-18^false^ Super easy to use- never needed to use a window insulating kit before but was pleasantly surprised at how much it helped the draft coming from my windows.^5.00
2^73^For us it was crapy... Might work for you. Not us^2016-01-16^false^ For us it did not work, we couldn\t get tape to stick nor plastic to shrink. For us this wasn\t a good buy and we needed up using duck tape lol^1.00
2^74^Reallt easy to use^2016-01-16^false^ Reallt easy to use. Great to cover the windows to keep out the cold air. This comes w double sided tape to help gmÄ£ <^5.00

2^79^NO MORE DRAFTS IN THE WINTER!^2016-01-12^false^ Yeah, I\m pretty happy about 3M\s whole system of these (no matter what size). There is a bit of a learning curve to get them to lay flat, but that\s life kids. I\ve been using them for the past 2 years and I live in Chicago. I can\t verify (due to changing weather temps) if I\ve saved money on my heating bill, but I\d like to think so. It\s well worth the price of them and I DEFINITELY notice the drafts stopped. The windows are always icing up ,from condensation, once it gets below 32º. I\ve tried ceiling fans to keep the air flowing, but to no avail. These window films do the trick every time. No more icing up. No more water from condensation on my window sills. No more mold growth from the moisture. Buy them, put them up and stay warm all season.^5.00
2^80^Great product^2016-01-21^false^ Easy to use...^5.00

2^82^Otherwise it\s a fine product.^2016-01-10^false^ There are not 5 different sheet of material for 5 windows, rather there is one large sheet that you have to cut into 5 pieces to make it work for 5 windows. Otherwise it\s a fine product.^4.00
2^83^No hassle-no storrage-no cold draft !^2016-01-06^false^ It did a perfect job of keeping the cold air out around our A/C so that we did not have the hassle of removal and storage.^5.00
2^84^Great product easy installation^2016-01-12^false^ This is the first time I used 3M window insulation and istallation was a breeze. The scotch tape held like a champ and the plastic is so clear that if you give it good heat from the hair dryer it almost feels like there is nothing in front of window. Highly recommended for the cold weather. Our heat is off for good few hours during the day and night^5.00
3^85^This little unit SAVED my neighbors house from a 2-story fire.^2016-01-11^false^ I purchased this fire extinguisher in 2001, and it has sat on my kitchen counter ever since. On March 17th, 2012, my next door neighbor was outside his house and VERY FOOLISHLY poured gasoline from a full 2.5-gallon container onto a pile of hot smoldering wooden logs. Of course the can exploded and it landed against the outside of his 2-story house. The house is wood frame house with painted wood siding. At this point he was on fire, so he rolled on the ground to put himself out. He ended up with 3rd degree burns, but his next action was to get up and come find me. I was working outside raking leaves when I heard him screaming. By this time the fire is raging against the outside of his house. The flames were about 8-10\ wide against the side of his house and touching the top of his 2nd story gutter. As he was panicking and calling 911, I quickly retrieved the small Kiddie fire extinguisher from my kitchen and ran towards the blaze. At this point I am thinking I am shooting a bb-gun ...

3^86^Must-have car safety.^2016-01-16^false^ These should be in every car. There is no reason not to have one on you even just driving in a city and daily commuting. It could mean the difference in saving a car, or a life. I have 2 in my Jeep, especially when off roading.^5.00
3^87^Good for NYE^2016-01-15^false^ Purchased after a crazy NYE night where it took two of the things to put out trash can fire in the garage. Must have for any middle aged man wanting to save face while putting out fires from used fire works in a garbage can.^4.00

4^105^Nice quality^2016-01-22^false^ I purchased this bottle scrubber to clean the glass water bottles I have because I don\t feel they come super clean from the dishwasher. This brush works fine for one of my bottles but the bristles are more stuff than I hoped for and it\s not flexible. The brush is good quality though and feels like it will last a very long time^4.00
4^106^Great product for a fair price^2016-01-16^false^ Fits into nooks and crannies of bottle and breast pump parts, which has greatly assisted efficient cleaning. 4-star rating because, for these purposes, the handle and neck are a bit long, and there is no stand. The brush is a bit more awkward to store in the kitchen. Otherwise, a great product that is priced well.^4.00
4^107^Perfect brush for my Nalgene bottles^2016-01-18^false^ Perfect brush for my Nalgene bottles! Gets into the wide mouth and the smaller water bottle sized mouth. Once this one gets wrecked from vigorous cleaning, I\ll be sure to pick up another!^5.00

5^147^Used and Misadvertised^2016-01-18^false^ I checked the product details and the packaging mine arrived in is different from what is advertised. The advertised packaging specifically says it is the only original U.S. packaging, and yet mine was completely different in shape, form, and design. This problem is in addition to the fact that the infuser displayed wear and tear symptomatic of use despite the fact that it was purchased new.^1.00
5^148^Good design bad quality^2016-01-13^false^ I like the design. But the quality is so bad. I used it about 5 days a week. The chain was detached at the third time. Well, that\s not a big deal. But it got so much metal rust(I thought it\s tea stains but not) whitin one month. I don\t feel safe...^2.00
5^149^I will definitely be looking for a better one.^2015-12-29^false^ It doesn\t close properly and the loose leaf tea I use always comes out into the water and I have to pick a lot of it out. I will definitely be looking for a better one.^1.00
5^150^Worthless^2016-01-20^false^ Crap. When closed still has massive gaps so all but the largest tea pieces float out. Might as well dump loose leaf tea right into your water, it would be just as good.^1.00
5^151^Leaks^2016-01-01^false^ For the money, I really can\t complain about this tea ball. The only thing is that it doesn\t shut all the way so every cup of tea has lingering loose leaves within it.^3.00
5^152^Works great and bonus instructions =)^2016-01-13^false^ Easy clasp to open and hook to latch onto cup handle. They also tell you how much tea for each cup, which was handy for me as I am new to the loose leaf game.^5.00
5^153^LOVE THESE BAGS!!^2016-01-18^false^ These bags are awesome! First time shopping for reusable bags and I picked a winner. Even checkers have asked me where I got them. Love them ð???ð??»^5.00
5^154^Practical^2016-01-18^false^ Great, practical stainless steel mesh ball. Perfect size and the material doesn\t leave any taste in the beverage. I would recommend it.^5.00

5^156^Loose leaf pieces in my tea^2016-01-18^false^ I bought to make large portions of loose leaf tea but the leaves fall out of the sides and into my tea so I rarely use it.^1.00
5^157^Worked great up to that point^2016-01-14^false^ Lost the lip clip (the link at the loose end of the chain) after maybe 3 days. Worked great up to that point.^3.00

6^183^Indispensable tool in my kitchen.^2016-01-20^false^ I couldn\t live without this tool in my kitchen. I am zesting and grating regularly and having a Microplane in easy reach is an essential. I have several styles of Microplanes (for grating different things and different sizes) but this is the one I use the most for limes, lemons, oranges, etc. Fits right in the dishwasher when I am done and is always sharp and useful. This was a replacement for one that I had had for many years and it had finally gotten a little dull. But after ten years of essentially daily use, I guess it was allowed to be not so sharp.^5.00
6^184^Micropla really is a great grater^2016-01-22^false^ Microplane is a great grater. We bought this planer on the advice of our daughter whose kitchen philosophy is have a few gadgets but make them high quality. This grater planer works very well. I typically use it to zest lemons or to grate Parmesan cheese. It does both jobs perfectly and is easy to clean. NowI buy cheese in a block which is better, cheaper and keeps longer.^5.00
6^185^Get rid of that garlic press!^2016-01-15^false^ So this has become one of my favorite kitchen tools. I use it to easily grate down garlic into a fine consistency that almost melts into soups and sauces. It\s also perfect for getting the zest off of lemons or oranges. It\s a delightfully versatile tool that is absolutely worth it.^5.00
6^186^This microplane is fantastic and I use it every day^2016-01-20^false^ This microplane is fantastic and I use it every day!! Great for mincing garlic, zesting lemons or limes, grating cheese, etc. Have bought additional ones for friends and family - great buy.^5.00
6^187^Fantastic zester^2016-01-06^false^ A must have , if you need a zester. So easy to use and makes fast work of citrus peel. You can quickly add citrus zest and clean up is so easy. Storage of this slim item is easy too.^5.00
6^188^Love this gadget.^2016-01-12^false^ Love these. I purchased one for myself a while back and loved it so much, I got one for each of my daughters. It\s reasonably priced and the quality is very nice as well.^5.00
6^189^So many other microplaners fell apart but this one is great and we use it all the time^2016-01-15^false^ We\ve had this for two years. So many other microplaners fell apart but this one is great and we use it all the time. I only wish it were slightly easier to clean.^5.00
6^190^Works great on zest and hard cheeses^2015-12-28^false^ I love this Microplane. We use it mostly for citrus zest and parmasen cheeses on our pastas. Its dishwasher safe. It can be sharp though so be careful.^5.00
6^191^Great zester^2016-01-13^false^ The first few times I used it I ended up with a little bit too much finger in my finger food, if you know what I mean. Watch yourself.^5.00
6^192^BEST BUY I EVER MADE!^2015-12-28^false^ Love this Zester! It give me the type of zest I need without it being mush. Very well made an not hard to clean.^5.00

8^232^Good Design but Fragile Cap is a deal breaker^2015-12-22^false^ The key to a good coffee or spice grinder is a non-oval non-elliptical interior that kicks the spice into the blades. Krups adds a flat side to the cap interior so it does this and grinds well but Krups makes the cap from a cheap brittle plastic that spontaneously cracks from normal use. I patched the first crack but others kept coming -- there are already five after three months of use -- and this means that cap will sooner rather than later break apart. (See photo) Amazon\s price was $19.99 but I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon that brought the price to $15.00.^3.00
8^233^Great grinder for spices, but not coffee^2015-12-22^false^ Pros: Cheap, powerful motor and blades Cons: Uneven grind, smallish capacity If you\re looking for a coffee grinder, I wouldn\t recommend a bladed one, especially if you care about using the right size grind for the right drink. Blade grinders are cheap, but a burr grinder ensures a uniform grind, which is important to get a consistent flavor and brew. This grinder, however, would be perfect for spices, and I would actually recommend using it only for that. Cleaning is relatively easy: just use a damp paper towel to wipe up the remains and a dry one to finish the job.^4.00
8^234^I got this for my parents who love coffee. They didn\t really like this product and ...^2016-01-19^false^ I got this for my parents who love coffee. They didn\t really like this product and actually went back to their old coffee grinder.. Something about how the beans weren\t grinded up too well or something.. So I\m guessing this product isn\t really for coffee addicts.^2.00
8^235^Does powder all your food items, but is impossible to clean without washing.^2016-01-11^false^ This thing can grind! It has ground up everything I have placed in it with ease! Now the bad stuff. The unit is really really hard to clean. The only way to keep it clean is to wash it after every use. I use it to grind up foods I have dehydrated. It has powdered up sweet peppers, carrots, kale, beets, lime, ginger, and turbinado sugar. So after each use I had to clean it up. It was a big chore due to not having any napkins! I bought a brush to clean it but it isn\t the best thing and you will need to put some water in it to get the dust out from the bottom of the blade. The unit does seem to be waterproof but I am not trying to find out. It did shoot water out from the lid so I learned really fast to only place a small amount in there at a time as to allow the particles stuck under the blade to remove themselves. The unit itself is surprisingly heavy. After a few uses it stopped working but with a few shakes it would turn on. I believe it stopped working due to the lid not being down all the way. I want to process coffee beans at least once to see the end results but from my experience I don\t know how anyone could get anything but a fine grind. It seems to powder everything in seconds. In seconds you can see powder forming on the lid. I have no idea how I would get a coarse grind with the KRUPS. Maybe the result is different with coffee beans than with dehydrated food. I imagine I would have to pulse it for no longer than a second. This is exactly what I was looking for though in the end so I give it 5 stars.^5.00
8^236^Krups F203 Coffee grinder^2016-01-16^false^ Replaced a really old grinder of similar type by Cusinart, This one works great and I like it since it has a larger capacity for beans so I can grind more at once. Of course the grind depends on how long you hold the button down. I like mine ground fine for an espresso machine. Some powder tends to cake under the blades. I have developed a habit of holding it up when I push the button and tilt it sideways back and forth during grinding to facilitate mixing. One would do well to count the seconds for the grind you like so to be more consistent over time. I believe it takes about 10 seconds to get to a fine enough grind. After done I put the gound coffee into a small can making a day or two\s worth at one time so it is always fresh. One needs to use their finger or another object to get the caked product out of the bottom but it is not a big deal. It is easy to clean with a paper towel around the inside tapping the remainder out. I found a small brush which I use to get grind out of the crevasses. Overall I find it is a great value and works well for small portions.^5.00
8^237^The only spice mill you\ll ever need!^2016-01-02^false^ I buy and use whole spices from a health food store. It is fresher and cheaper than packaged spices on the grocery shelves. It allows me the flexibility to purchase exact amounts for a particular recipe without wasting the unused portions. Instead of buying individual spice mills I wanted one mill that could do all types of grinding, coarse or fine. I went to America\s Tedt Kitchen website to read their reviews. This product was 5 star rated. Knowing I could trust their experience and review I purchased the mill. It livesup to its claim! It has a removable cup for easy pouring and cleaning. It\s the only spice mill I need. And yes, it does awesome with coffee beans, nuts, etc. I highly recommend this product! It is easy, quick, and produces an even grind.^5.00
8^238^Highly rated â?¦ TOO MESSY!^2016-01-15^false^ On a mission to replace my last coffee bean grinder I spent considerable time reading reviews of the top-rated ones. I finally decided on this one. Big mistake. The KRUPS F203 does, indeed, grind coffee beans. But trying to transfer the grounds to oneâ??s coffee maker results in a huge mess. (I wouldnâ??t know but perhaps this highly rated grinder would be appropriate for grinding spices. But itâ??s way too messy for daily grinding of coffee beans.) Summary: I quit grinding coffee beans shortly after I started using this grinder. Thanks to this purchase, Iâ??m back to buying pre-ground coffee. Gimme my old grinder back! Recommendation: against all reviews, do not buy.^1.00
8^239^Great little coffee grinder, perfect for a cramped kitchen^2016-01-18^false^ This is my first ever coffee grinder and I chose this one because of the low cost and the compact design. It has been fantastic addition to our kitchen. We have fresh ground coffee every day, so delicious! It is incredibly easy to use, not too noisy and so compact, I can tuck it away in the corner and it takes up no space. My only complaint is that it is fairly easy to spill some on the counter when opening the top after you\re done grinding. I\m not sure if this is a universal problem with grinders or the design of this one. I just try to be extra careful to minimize spillage. So happy I chose this grinder.^5.00
8^240^The FERRARI of grinders. Spend the extra money and get this, it cannot be beaten.^2016-01-21^false^ When you are looking for a grinder you do not realize how important they are until you get this one. Then you grind your first cup of beans, and OMG. This little machine is unbeatable. It is like the ferrari of Grinders. 5 seconds and you have a perfect ground blend ready to make your day start off with a Bang. I used some in the military that actually stunk, they were slow, got stuck, not this one. This one takes a mundane task and makes it extra ordinary. I will use a Krups for the rest of my life no doubt about it.^5.00
8^241^Grinding cup is not removable, and product is difficult ...^2016-01-20^false^ Grinding cup is not removable, and product is difficult to clean. . I have to turn the grinder upside down and tap with a spoon to get the ground coffee out of the grind chamber, and there is a reside of coffee left on the lid as well as the chamber. You cannot adjust the grind and the top can be difficult to remove at times. I have to use a damp paper towel to clean the unit every time I use it which is a pain.^3.00
8^242^NOT For Coffee Grinding^2016-01-15^false^ Pros: +Easy to use +Compact design +Reasonably priced Cons: -This should only be used for grinding spices. I do not suggest using this for coffee. You will NOT get a consistent texture/grain size. Buy a burr grinder for your coffee beans instead. -Difficult to clean the blade fully (especially underneath the blade). You\ll have to use a pipe cleaner or a thin piece of fabric.^3.00
8^243^I have BEAN wanting this grinder for so long!^2015-12-31^false^ I have had this on my wish list for a while and got this for Christmas from my Father-n-Law. We both love coffee and love the strange brews from all over the world. I have a different coffee maker than he does so this will come in great use when I give him coffee. I ground my first batch already. I didnt grind the whole bag because that will ruin the flavr of the bean.^5.00
8^244^Bought this one to replace an earlier model that I\d ...^2016-01-21^false^ Bought this one to replace an earlier model that I\d been using since 1978. The earlier model still worked well, but it looked awful after years of use and some accidents. I expect this model will last as long ... it certainly does the job well. I detect no loss of quality from the earlier model. I use mine for grinding spices, and just occasionally for grinding coffee beans.^5.00
8^245^This is great! I bought 3 bags of whole bean coffee ...^2016-01-17^false^ This is great! I bought 3 bags of whole bean coffee online by mistake and didn\t want to return them so I bought this grinder. It\s fast, easy to use, and the cleanup is simple. I don\t know how long this sort of appliance usually lasts but regardless, it\s cheap enough that I wouldn\t mind replacing it after a few years. Wonderful buy!^5.00
8^246^It actually grinds finer than my more expensive grinder^2016-01-18^false^ This works well for small quantities. It actually grinds finer than my more expensive grinder, which has several settings. That said, this grinds finely so if you need a coaster grind, this may not be ideal. It arrived in proper packaging and has been in use for nearly a year and still performs wonderfully.^5.00
8^247^Good, not great^2016-01-18^false^ This is a pretty good coffee grinder, but coffee tends to pack around the edges of the inside, requiring a utensil to scrape the coffee out. Also, if you\re doing a fine grind, it\s sometimes hard to get very fine unless you fill it at least 2/3. But generally works well, and no problems with the motor.^4.00
8^248^Strong little grinder, strange lid design^2015-12-26^false^ Strong little grinder and works as you would expect. The issues are with the actual lid. To get the food/coffee from the top you will ned to turn the whole thing upside dow and pat the machine to get it all out without a huge mess. Not a big deal but that great of a design^4.00
8^249^The grinder works great and you\ll get very fine powder^2015-12-27^false^ I bought this for grinding dried peppers for jerky and curry making. The grinder works great and you\ll get very fine powder, be careful though as the dust can get in the air quite easily and like me you\ll be end up with a runny nose, sneezing for 15 minutes or so, oops.^5.00
8^250^MESSY but grinds^2015-12-01^false^ This makes a huge mess! Coffee grinds everywhere. Need a brush to get them out. Grinds get compacted under the blades and will not come out unless you use a brush and then it becomes a mess. I am shopping for something else. Do NOT buy this!^1.00
8^251^Works perfectly!^2016-01-16^false^ Love this spice grinder! It works on everything, literally. Plus, when I have to grind coffee beans occasionally for relatives, the smell doesn\t linger inside afterward as long as I clean it well with a wet cloth. No complaints!^5.00
8^252^Fine grounds^2016-01-16^false^ This grinder works very well with the regular filter coffee makers. I found the grounds were too small for my reusable k-cup. Which may just mean a new k-cup would do the trick. However, the quality of this product is great.^4.00
8^253^Perfect!^2016-01-14^false^ Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he just loves it! It\s incredibly easy to use (one button operation!) Easy to clean as well. Plus it makes the kitchen smell great while it\s grinding coffee beans :)^5.00
8^254^I just wish it did a better job of uniformly grinding the beans^2016-01-11^false^ Small and powerful. Not much else to be said here. I just wish it did a better job of uniformly grinding the beans. Other than that, this thing works flawlessly. A little messy but it\s coffee. Whadyagonado?^4.00
8^255^So far so good. I initially bought a hand grinder - ceramic ...^2016-01-06^false^ So far so good. I initially bought a hand grinder - ceramic type to keep the coffee as pure as possible.., but I found that it was taking WAY too long to grind. This is a good, fast solution.^5.00
8^256^Nice, simple grinder^2016-01-20^false^ This is a nice, simple little grinder. You can\t grind huge batches of coffee at a time, but that\s fine for us. I haven\t used it for spices, yet, but I\m sure it will work great when I do.^5.00
8^257^Great Product^2016-01-16^false^ This product is excellent. Its inexpensive and made with quality. Its a great coffee grinder. There are no fancy settings. You control the type of grind manually. But its very easy use.^5.00
8^258^Quietly gets the job done^2016-01-21^false^ I purchased this to replace a coffee grinder that I previously had for 10 years. I have used this for coffee and spices. Works great. Runs smoothly and quietly.^5.00
8^259^Made in Chine beware not Krups Quality and the overall review score does not represent the current model^2016-01-15^false^ Yikes. The current model is made in China and fills the room with a very pungent electricity smell and does not have the power my old Krups Grinder had. DO NOT BUY^1.00
8^260^Excellent tool. We had it for over a year ...^2015-12-23^false^ Excellent tool. We had it for over a year with no problems. Does a good job grinding coffee does not heat the grounds too much and keeps the oils and flavores in.^5.00
8^261^I bought this for my son and he loves it ...^2016-01-10^false^ I bought this for my son and he loves it. It grinds the coffee beans perfectly and fast. He really likes the fact this grinder also grinds spices too!^5.00
8^262^Better than most^2016-01-13^false^ Nice fine grounds does a great job. These units usually don\t last more than a year, time will tell if this holds true for this unit.^4.00
8^263^Great for coffee and spices^2015-11-11^false^ We own two of these. One for spices and one for coffee. They work great and are super easy to clean (we just use a little bit of dried rice).^5.00
8^264^I wish I knew about this earlier!^2016-01-18^false^ My first time ever using this or grinding coffee. So easy! Coffee is so much better and fresher! I love this size because it\s only for me.^5.00
8^265^Grinds well, quiet but the lid leaves a little ...^2016-01-19^false^ Grinds well, quiet but the lid leaves a little to be desired. It is long and fits inside causing beans and grounds to cling to the sides.^3.00
8^266^Great purchase!^2016-01-03^false^ I love this product. It\s small so it\s easy to store, it\s quick and efficient and not very loud. And I got it for a great price.^5.00
8^267^Such fine powder for hot peppers. Love it.^2015-12-30^false^ I use this to pulverize my dehydrated hot peppers from my garden. Grinds them into the finest dust. Just what I needed.^5.00
8^268^I just needed to grind my own coffee as I ...^2015-12-04^false^ I just needed to grind my own coffee as I am becoming a coffee snob. This seems to do well but I am just learning so....^4.00
8^269^I love it!^2015-11-23^false^ I use it every morning. Works great! I put 8 Tbsp of coffee beans in it. Takes about 10s to turn them into a fine powder.^5.00
8^270^Since I bought it, I have used it almost ...^2015-11-21^false^ Since I bought it, I have used it almost everyday. The only problem is that the coffee ground sticks to the container.^4.00
8^271^Nice shape for pouring directly into coffee maker once chopped^2015-11-19^false^ Does the job perfectly. Nice shape for pouring directly into coffee maker once chopped. Great price, recommend highly.^5.00
8^272^Solid^2016-01-19^false^ Great grinder for coffee. Durable. Replaces our old Braun grinder.Simple one function grind, no bells or whistles.^4.00
8^273^but not as fine as I\d hoped^2015-10-23^false^ This was my first attempt at grinding. I was not impressed. Functioned sufficiently, but not as fine as I\d hoped.^3.00
8^274^Good grinder^2016-01-18^false^ Basic coffee grinder, not very loud, grinds beans perfectly, use daily, clean with a small unused makeup brush.^5.00
8^275^Smart Purchase^2016-01-06^false^ Just purchased and I really like it so far. It\s super simple design and low noise makes for a great grinder =)^5.00

9^324^... Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\m doing here right now)^2016-01-14^false^ I had the same problem that others on Amazon are having with this product (who likely left bad reviews as I\m doing here right now). I just purchased this same filter from Walmart recently along with a brand new Brita water pitcher (yes both the filter and pitcher are new and compatible with each other...and the filter that came with the pitcher had the same issue as well). I thought I was crazy as to why quite a bit of the dirty water was leaking through the filter around the edges of where the filter sits flush with the pitcher housing; and watching the \dirty\ water drip around the actual filter and into the clean water reservoir I just cringed and scratched my head... After triple checking and making sure the filter was properly rotated so that it inserted into the unit all the way properly, I pushed so darn hard that I was ready for the unit to break, the filter looked flush with the water pitcher housing...and alas, water still leaks through and the filter clearly does NOT seal well with this unit. I find it almost humorous that I only came here to read these Amazon reviews describing the same exact issues after I decided to Google my problem and see if there was a magic solution, and I see Brita repeatedly replying with we\re sorry! call our customer service and we will help!...or you need to insert the filter properly by lining it up and firmly pressing down. If you go onto Brita\s website and look up their advanced water filters for sale and check out the customer reviews there, you will ALSO find more dissapointed customers complaining about the water filters not properly sealing and allowing dirty water to pass through...along with the same sad responses from Brita support which seemingly makes Brita look like they\re being proactive. Unfortunately as in this case, sometime\s replying with the same canned responses that don\t really solve the problem is just as bad as no customer service or reply as well; clearly Brita is in denial or won\t publicly accept fault for this issue. I think the worst part in all of this though, is that there are likely many consumers who get their new Brita and set it up and are excited or just used to the way their old Brita filters worked, and they don\t even bother to look carefully and see whether or not any dirty water is getting through the filter because it doesn\t seal properly/completely in a water-tight fashion within the water pitcher apparatus. So all of the great things Brita says about it keeping you and your family safe by filtering your water is somewhat misleading with product defects like this. You\re buying a filter to clean your water, you don\t even notice its NOT cleaning your water, and you go on happily and ignorantly drinking your slightly-less-dirty water that still has some contaminants in it because the filter doesn\t seal well. The essential function function of a water filter like this is to filter ALL of the water, not just most of it...if the product can\t filter 99.99999% of the water being poured into it, then it is most certainly a defective product. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Brita that they aren\t purposely and knowingly selling a defective filter-design, it\s still pretty apparent that they have a pretty high number of manufacturing defects going on where the plastic isn\t lining up and providing a perfect seal between the water pitchers and advanced water filters. FYI, Brita Customer Service, if you respond to my message with anything less than something like you are correct, we apologize for selling a flawed product for some time now as evidenced by countless negative reviews, and we are in the works to create a new and better design that keeps the water filter tightly, properly, and easily sealed when inserted...then I know you haven\t read or care about what I say or anyone else has been complaining about regarding this issue. No need for me to call Brita customer service either, I\m going to buy a filter now from your competitor and I can only hope it works the way it should. Thanks for reading and please escalate this complaint to your CEO and COO and any other concerned parties who will actually take notice of this and resolve the problem without pushing it under the carpet.^1.00
9^325^I love Brita Filters!^2016-01-11^false^ I bought my brita pitcher years ago, and the filters looked different when I first bought it so I was nerves that my pitcher was too old and it would not fit. But, it was no problem since these filters fit perfectly. The top of these filters look different. It has a thinner top. I love it because it is easier to grab and take out of the pitcher. The old filters I had to struggle with to get out. Sometimes I had to disassemble to top of the pitcher and push the filter from underneath. These new filters seem to get rid of that problem! Also, there is barely any pre-soaking required! I got these out of the package expecting to soak them in a bowl for several hours, but the instructions said to just rinse it for a few seconds. So no more having to get a bowl out for filter replacements! The quality of the water is good too; I donâ??t notice any difference in the quality of water from the old filters. The price is reasonable. I got a five pack for $24.56. This comes out to under 13 cents per gallon if I use the recommended 40 gallons per filter.^5.00
9^326^I use these filters in my Brita pitcher to transfer ...^2016-01-09^false^ I use these filters in my Brita pitcher to transfer the filtered water into my 5 gallon jug that sits on the cooler. I refuse to spend $12 for 5 gallons of spring water I have no idea if it really is spring water. I let my water sit open for 24 hours or more prior to filtering so the chlorine can vaporize and leave the water. This allows the filters to last longer.^5.00
9^327^Only good for chlorine^2016-01-14^false^ I have a water tester and my water tested with as many or more particles after using the filter. It does get rid of the chlorine and they put a lot of chlorine in our water (rural water system).^2.00
9^328^Non-Brita filters and they just aren\t as good unfortunately. These new Brita filters also do not ...^2016-01-20^false^ Tried the cheaper, Non-Brita filters and they just aren\t as good unfortunately. These new Brita filters also do not require a 15 minute soak in water,. you instead just run cold water over the water filter now for 15 seconds and it is ready to go. Also, there are so far a lot less black flecks in the top of the Brita canister and the water tastes great. Overall, to save a $1.50-2 (ish) dollars, the off-brand filters are just not worth it, my guess is they do not contain as much activated charcoal, I base this on my vast knowledge of water filter technology and science background that comes with being a communications major, so basically, nothing, but the filter is great.^5.00
9^329^Love the quality of the water.^2016-01-14^false^ I do not buy bottled water! I drink tap water---sometimes funny tasting tap water---hold yer nose Sulfur water that I\m told is good for me. Um. But! Two years ago I was gifted with a Brita Pitcher. It really makes a difference. I soon needed replacement filters because I followed manufacturer\s instructions. DON\T FOLLOW MANUFACTURE\S INSTRUCTIONS! I\ve found that I can use Brita filters for many months and the water quality is crystal clear and without any unpleasant taste. I only replace filters when the filter gets clogged up.^5.00
9^330^Now they made so it\s very easy to get out and you do not have to ...^2016-01-21^false^ I started using the Brita water Pitcher over 5 years ago. I always complained about how hard it was to remove the filter from the pitcher, until now. Thank jesus for R&D. Now they made so it\s very easy to get out and you do not have to soak it in a glass of water anymore. These filter works great and you can really tell the difference when drinking water. No chlorine taste and no charcoal flakes floating around in the water. Good price great product. I only gave it 4 stars because 5 stars are meant for angels and gods.^4.00
9^331^Great tasting water!^2016-01-09^false^ Works like it should. Water tastes great filtered with this.^5.00
9^332^womanzon^2016-01-14^false^ a great price for all three^5.00

9^334^Brita slim 5 cup pitcher replacement^2016-01-06^false^ For perfectly in the Brita slim 5 cup pitcher^5.00
9^335^Filter leaks and a large portion of the water does ...^2016-01-22^false^ Filter leaks and a large portion of the water does not get filtered through my Brita 10 cup Grand Water pitcher. I purchased this filter so as to remove the unpleasant taste of tap water, this filter only diminishes the taste as much of the water still gets through unfiltered as this does not accurately fit my pitcher.^2.00
9^336^Refreshing!^2016-01-21^false^ Yeah, this is a Brita review, because why? Because these little boxes of charcoal make my disgusting, dirty hot tub smelling municipal chlorine and flouride bath straight from the sewer tap water taste like I\m drinking straight form the freshest mountain stream. These things work wonders!^5.00
9^337^Works well, it did come loose in the pitcher ...^2016-01-13^false^ Works well, it did come loose in the pitcher once and carbon dust came out and settled at the bottom. After repositioning the filter and cleaning the bottom of the pitcher, there was no more carbon dust.^5.00
9^338^Can\t live with out them^2016-01-19^false^ I love these. They are more people expensive at the store so better to by then on Amazon. I did not give them a 5 star because. I can\t tell what is actually filtered out only a lab could.^4.00
9^339^Good deal.^2016-01-19^false^ Been buying these replacement filters for years. Great price with this bulk purchase. Really makes my water taste delightful. Also use filtered water in coffee maker and iron.^5.00
9^340^...but I don\t use the Brita water bottles...^2016-01-17^false^ Switched to Pur because these filters went bad so quickly. Now the Pur filters take forever to filter, but still better than Brita. In my opinion.^3.00
9^341^New And Improved ..... Meh!^2016-01-03^false^ fits better ..... Water taste exactly like that comes out of the rap which is awful. Shame,I\ve been a happy customer for many years.^1.00

10^389^Great product. Be careful with stirring it when you ...^2016-01-01^false^ Great product. Be careful with stirring it when you are making Carmel/sweet corn. The handle has a plastic gear on it and that can break if you twist it too hard or too fast. I love making my own popcorn with olive oil, and a little salt. You don\t need to buy their brand of popcorn. They are great tasting but they are expensive. DO NOT buy another brand of ready to use popcorn oil and salt bags. If they are cheap, they will taste horrible. Just use regular popcorn, one tablespoon popcorn to one tablespoon olive oil. 4-5 tablespoons for 2 adults. Should be pretty close to perfect. Salt to preference. Great white elephant gift!!!!^5.00
10^390^There is no better snack on movie night in our house^2016-01-20^false^ Our family loves popcorn! We were buying bags upon bags of popcorn to pop as our night time snack during family time. There is no better snack on movie night in our house. That is why when I saw the Wabash Valley Farms Whirley-Pop I couldn\t wait to try it! I read the mixed reviews and was cautiously optimistic. The product arrived with a 5.5 oz Wabash Valley Real Theater Popcorn all-inclusive kit... WINNING! I was super excited for the bonus popcorn to try out our Whirley-pop for the first time! We made our first batch of popcorn the night it arrived. The directions included were super easy to follow, and in 3 1/2 minutes we had perfectly popped buttery popcorn. Just like that in 3 1/2 minutes I was mom of the year! The Whirley-pop was constructed really well. All the pieces look like they will last a long time. I had read a lot of comments about the gears breaking and I don\t know if the company has improved that piece but mine appear to be extremely solid and well made. I will update again after continued use.^5.00
10^391^Great product otherwise, but you might want to consider this issue.....^2016-01-18^false^ I purchased the Whirley-Pop in June 2015 through Amazon, a little over 6 months ago. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it broke within 6 months and the Wabash Valley Farms replacement cost, despite its warranty, is something you might want to consider when you purchase, along with which version of the popper you\d like. I learned from the folks at WVF that the gears on the version Amazon sells are plastic. I hadn\t known there were two versions of this popper available from WVF, one with plastic gears and one with die cast metal gears. WVF said that Amazon opted to sell this version only but I could be upgraded to a replacement cover with the metal gears for an additional cost. Wabash Valley Farms has a 25 year warranty on its products, but it cost me an additional $16+ to upgrade to the metal-geared cover. I thought I should warn other potential customers that, given the REAL cost of a replacement that would last, they might want to purchase the version with the metal gears in the first place.^4.00
10^392^I Can Finally Make Popcorn As Good As Grandma\s^2014-04-19^false^  The Whirley Pop is the best thing since sliced bread!! Ever since I was a little girl I have loved homemade popcorn. My grandmother would make it for us whenever we spent the night. Theater and microwave popcorn cannot hold a candle to Grandma\s popcorn. A friend recently gave us a Whirley Pop popcorn popper. Oh my goodness! This thing is the bomb!! Tonight I made my second batch, and it was as perfect as the first one was. NOT ONE SINGLE UNPOPPED KERNAL! I seasoned the pot per the enclosed instructions before first use. For both batches I used 3 Tablespoons vegetable oil and one half cup Orville Redenbocker\s Original Gourmet Popping Corn. Both batches turned out perfectly. I attached video to demonstrate how easy it is to use and the amount of popcorn in a single batch.^5.00
10^393^Awesome tasting popcorn^2016-01-14^false^ I had recently tried Kettle Korn and fell in love with the salty and sweet taste. I tried to recreate it at home but just burnt my pots, twice. I looked up some recipes and came across a clip of Martha Stewart making some with the Whirley-Pop. After watching the video I placed an order for it. When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a bag of popcorn with butter. I tried to make the kettle corn again and this time, it was a success. I have also made regular butter popcorn successfully. If you do kettle corn, add the sugar and salt a minute after you put all the corn kernels in, They will be a whitish color, that\s the best time to add it in.^5.00
10^394^but I feel like that\s a small price to pay^2016-01-09^false^ This popcorn popper is simple, but works so well! I received it as a gift and I won\t make popcorn with anything else. I use 1/2 cup of Pop Secret popcorn and a little bit of corn oil and I get 10 cups of perfectly popped popcorn. Every time. I just made some and had just one unpopped kernel. The only downside is that you have to hand wash lid/handle, but I feel like that\s a small price to pay. Love it...highly recommend!!^5.00
10^395^cheap metal but fun to use^2016-01-12^false^ what keeps me from loving it is the material used. it feels like thin cheap metal that will damage pretty quickly, i.e. burn marks that won\t clean up as well as a pain to clean on the inside. waiting to see what happens 5 uses in, but so far so good. just wish the metal was a little more sturdy or thick/firm.^4.00
10^396^Ruined my stovetop^2016-01-16^false^ I bought this product because I knew it would be far healthier than microwave popcorn. It scratched the hell out of my stovetop with one use. I never moved the pan, just twirled. The bottom of the pan appeared to not be flat. It wobbled all over the burner. Don\t buy this product if you value you stove.^1.00
10^397^Best present ever! (my wife\s words!)^2016-01-18^false^ I bought this as a surprise for my popcorn loving wife. Her words, one of the be presents ever! She is beyond pleased with the quality of the popping and taste of the popcorn. It works just the way it is described and eliminates clean up too! If you like popcorn, you will love the Whirley-Pop!^5.00

He bought me a new pot for Christmas :) This popcorn maker is awesome for folks who just don\t like the taste of air popped. the handle is connected to a wire I believe he\s used the thing every day since Christmas.^5.00

10^400^I love popcorn. I use jiffy pop kernels or Orville ...^2016-01-14^false^ slight pain to clean. Not it\s fault really. I love popcorn. I use jiffy pop kernels or Orville Reddenbachers and a bit of peanut oil to make the popcorn. Cabot Cheddar shake from wabash valley farms seals the deal. Its like crack, you can\t stop eating it.^5.00
10^401^Absolutely love it!^2016-01-14^false^ Works beautifully! Saves money compared to microwave popcorn. When you use this to pop corn you get a truly healthful snack. Low in calories; no artificial color, flavor or preservatives. I had forgotten how good freshly popped popcorn is.^5.00
10^402^Great product. Wish I had bought sooner^2015-12-15^false^ LOVE IT!!! Easy to use, easy to clean. I was a bit worried that my lack of hand strength would make it hard to crank, but not an issue in the least. Leaves very few unpops, much healthier than microwave and just as fast.^5.00
10^403^I love this popcorn maker^2016-01-21^false^ I love this popcorn maker! We have given up making instant popcorn and only do on the stove popcorn! It doesn\t take that much longer and it tastes so much better! I definitely recommend this product!^5.00
10^404^Great popper! Have used for years.^2016-01-18^false^ Have been using one of these for several years now. Great product..works well, pops complete, and easy clean up, just wipe down. Also bought one for my parent\s and brother\s places for when we visit.^5.00
10^405^User friendly!^2016-01-16^false^ User friendly! Had to discontinue using my previous pop corn popper because of sustaining first degree burns all over my palms. Happy that this one\s ergonomic layout won\t allow such to happen again.^5.00
10^406^My favorite popcorn maker^2016-01-20^false^ Way easier than holding a lid down while shaking the pot, I haven\t had a burnt kernel yet. Seems well made with metal gears. Do yourself a favor and get a Whirley-Pop; stop eating microwave popcorn!^5.00
10^407^Plastic gears are junk^2016-01-20^false^ I bought two of these last summer and both broken in less than 6 months. The plastic gears broke on both of them after being used 1-2 times a week for less than 6 months.^2.00
10^408^Perfect Pop^2016-01-21^false^ This is hands down the best and only way to make popcorn. I now have popcorn at least three times a week for dinner thanks to this fabulous thing.^5.00
10^409^It makes great tasting popcorn^2016-01-05^false^ This is my second Whirley-Pop. The first one lasted over 15 years. It makes great tasting popcorn. The handle makes it safe for kids to help.^5.00

11^430^Works well as a kitchen thermometer^2016-01-21^false^ Seems like it\s about 6 degrees off at temperatures below 100, but dead on otherwise. I bought it to use brewing beer, so I needed something a bit more accurate for controlling fermentation tempature. However, I\ve started using it as a standard kitchen thermometer and it works great there! I would buy it again, certainly for the price, if I needed a kitchen thermometer or BBQ thermometer, but for a super accurate low temp thermometer, look elsewhere. Also, I tested it for freezer monitoring, and it will not read below 35 degree Fahrenheit. I give it 4 stars since it does work well, but not at the range I we hoping for.^4.00
11^431^Killed a beautiful brisket.^2016-01-15^false^ I used this thermometer on a beautiful cut of brisket in the smoker. It was taking longer than it should have to reach temperature for the proper smoking time. I used the old fashioned analog thermometer to find out I had over cooked it by 15 degrees. I was left with a delicious shoe.^1.00
11^432^Five Stars^2016-01-14^false^ You don\t need two, but this thing works so well you should buy two anyway.^5.00

12^439^Good value, not especially versatile^2016-01-22^false^ Solid roaster at a low price, will cook at 15 lb turkey (just). Because of the patterned surface on the bottom I wouldn\t use this for any other kind of cooking since it could be harder to clean. Therefore it is less versatile than heavier-gauge products would be. Also, with a 15 lb bird there is not a lot of space for vegetables underneath.^4.00
12^440^Like others have said^2016-01-12^false^ Like others have said, this arrived damaged. It was badly dented and the metal was flaking off. I actually got a sliver when I ran my hand over it. This is a poor quality product.^1.00
12^441^Cheapest qualitative roaster you could find on the internet^2016-01-14^false^ I used it for my very first homecooked Thanksgiving turkey and it was a huge success. I deeply recommend!^5.00

13^449^it was very sad since I have been ttc^2016-01-06^false^ The new first response tests are awful. Please go back to the old ones. Last month I got 4 positive tests on the new ones, and I wasn\t pregnant, it was very sad since I have been ttc.^1.00
13^450^Are these considered faint lines ???^2015-12-27^false^ I\m pretty sure I\m pregannt ! Today is my expected period, my last period was December 2 and I injtially took a test on dec 21 and was definitely a negative^5.00
13^451^Easy read tests^2016-01-13^false^ I didn\t have a problem using these and they were clear to read. I had a good experience with these and would recommend them^5.00
13^452^Indent and evap lines look like positives...^2016-01-13^false^ In my case, I tested for a situation that was pretty much impossible to get my pregnant. But I wanted to make sure due to a scheduled surgery, and I was being paranoid. Price is good, but these tests really weren\t. I got lines on two of them. They weren\t as clear as a positive would be, but I can definitely see how they would be misinterpreted as being positive, especially when, upon taking the thing apart, the second line had pink on the edges. So it doesn\t look like just an indent or an evap. It looked like a positive. I almost cancelled surgery over it, but thankfully went through and a previous blood test confirmed I wasn\t pregnant. Which I couldn\t be anyway. Pre-surgery nerves did something to my mind. But I bet you could dip these things into plain water and get that line, and the indent line being visible even when you don\t take it apart can make the test pretty confusing. In short I wouldn\t recommend these at all. The windows for me weren\t stark white and the viewing window was hard to see since it catches a lot of glare. I will say that I doubt a strong pink line would be an evap line, mine was very faint.^3.00

14^459^I\m disappointed in the quality of the seal^2016-01-13^false^ My family was ready to move from plastic storage to glass and I did my research, tried the Rubbermaid version, and ordered the Pyrex. The description says, Each has its own seal-tight, blue plastic lid. Let\s be clear... while the lids do sit firmly on the bowl, they ARE NOT leak proof. In fact, if the bowl is turned sideways, liquid will POUR out from under the lip of the lid. Time will tell how durable this set is, for the time being, I\m disappointed in the quality of the seal.^3.00
14^460^I works really well in storage my food. I ...^2016-01-11^false^ I works really well in storage my food. I don\t have so much time so I usually make a lot of food on Sunday and use this one to storage my food on refrigerator. These food storage also work well on microwave. Just be careful don\t immediately make changes in temperature. I usually get it out of my refrigerator for about 15 minutes before I put it into microwave to reheat my food is contained in it.^4.00
14^461^Broken lid, otberwise seem okay^2016-01-10^false^ It\s pyrex... Thick glass, matching lids. My only concern is how easily the lid broke in shipment. The 7x11 lid was under the glass dish it matched with. It broke at seam. Hopefully they start packing these better, they packed glass well but forgot about lids probably assuming they\d be fine. Otherwise, seem okay. Currently cooking with the dish... We shall see if it was more than just lid issue.^4.00
14^462^Love them^2016-01-14^false^ I typically purchase the standard plastic containers, but tired of the stains from spaghetti sauce and other foods. I love these containers. Thick and sturdy glass in various sizes. I originally wanted the red lids; however, the blue is really nice. Delivery was quick and the packaging was great. Lots of protection against breakage.^5.00
14^463^These are nice, sturdy storage pieces^2016-01-16^false^ These are nice, sturdy storage pieces. They are, however, much much smaller than I had originally anticipated. I wouldn\t have ordered if I had realized how small they actually are. They are Pyrex though, so they are of great quality. They are made of thick glass and have lids that fit well, giving them a nice and secure closure.^3.00
14^464^Very Useful Set^2015-12-26^false^ I love this set and use it all the time. So much better than the plastic ones and come out nicely clean in dishwasher...although do not put the lids in too. They are nicely sized with no too tiny ones you never use. Highly recommend this set for its quality and usefulness and nothing beats Pyrex.^5.00
14^465^My Favorite containers to Take to Work^2016-01-17^false^ Love these containers. They seal very well and haven\t had a problem with any leaking liquids or the lids falling off while storing food in my backpack on the way to work. They are pretty solid and feel heavy which makes them feel expensive. I got them on a deal and it was VERY worth the money I paid.^5.00
14^466^Perfect replacement for the old plastic containers^2016-01-22^false^ This a great set for cold storage and reheating. We replaced plastic containers that were staining and did not fare well on the microwave. These glass containers store easy by nesting in themselves and the lids fit well and seal tight I recommend this product^5.00
14^467^Great^2016-01-20^false^ Very versatile and great for everything from storage to good prep. Lids hold securely and air tight. They also stack pretty well and dont slip when on top of one another cause the lids are quite grippy. With proper care they will last forever as will most Pyrex products.^5.00
14^468^Great for storage and cooking^2016-01-17^false^ It\s so convenient to be able to store food in the same dish it was cooked in. I love this set! These are solid glass baking dishes just as we have come to expect from Pyrex. The covers fit snugly and stack easily if needed. Nice variety of sizes for different needs.^5.00
14^469^Great storage set^2016-01-09^false^ Very nice storage set that keeps food fresh for a long time. Pyrex is a brand I trust as I\ve dropped and clanged these dishes and they have not chipped or broke. I recieved the Pyrex 10 piece storage set at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.^5.00
14^470^Great alternative to plastic^2015-12-27^false^ Very nice, high quality. I use these to store all my tomato based sauces, as well as anything else that is acidic. They wash up great. There are no stains on these! Because of that, they look so much nicer than my old plastic containers ever did after one use.^5.00
14^471^Great overall^2016-01-14^false^ Great and practical overall. Only downside is that while Pyrex suggests that you use place the lid on top of the container when microwaving, I\ve had one instance of the lid basically imploding - now the lid is deformed and doesn\t work the way it sound.^4.00
14^472^Didn\t even bother buying bowls to go along with our plates as these were just fine. It\s not as great as the old durable ...^2016-01-17^false^ Variety of sizes. Use thse for everything. Didn\t even bother buying bowls to go along with our plates as these were just fine. It\s not as great as the old durable pyrex, but have not have broken one and thy\ve been all over.^5.00
14^473^Great set of storage containers.^2016-01-10^false^ The range of sizes is exactly what I needed. They store compactly, nestled inside each other (I put the lid on the bottom to separate the layers of glass. Microwave and dishwasher safe (top rack for lids).^5.00
14^474^Nice little set^2016-01-13^false^ Nice Set at the price. I love pyrex products and i needed a set like this. With the price it was a great deal. Covers are boring blue color but i don\t really mind that.^5.00
14^475^smaller than expected but good. tight seal^2016-01-20^false^ smaller than expected but good. tight seal, oven safe. I\d buy a ton more and give 5 stars if there was a more stackable solution. Still not easy to organize.^4.00
14^476^Pyrex is always a good brand!^2016-01-04^false^ You can\t really go wrong with Pyrex. All but the largest rectangle one fit in my lunch bag comfortably. Otherwise, great for food storage!^4.00
14^477^Got them for a great price, well worth it!^2016-01-18^false^ Bought them for my girlfriend, she loves them. They are super stout, and are all one color which my OCD girlfriend appreciates.^5.00
14^478^This is a very nice set of bowls from Pyrex^2016-01-09^false^ This is a very nice set of bowls from Pyrex. They are just the right size for leftovers and the dot pattern is cheerful too!^5.00
14^479^Great buy!^2015-12-28^false^ These are great leftover containers. I bought 2 packages and replaced a lot of plastic containers. These are a great buy!^4.00
14^480^Smaller than expected. But still Pyrex.^2016-01-19^false^ Pyrex is great quality but these are smaller than expected. But the price is great for the brand.^4.00
14^481^Love^2016-01-15^false^ I love Pyrex and have never been disappointed in one of their products! Great set of containers!^5.00

15^513^Everything is great with it^2016-01-22^false^ The ist one arrived & no lights workrd so sent it right back. They sent a replacement and everything works but the clock light never lights up. I wanted to send it back too,but my husband was sick of having no coffee so we kept it. Everything is great with it, but I just get mad everytime I look at it & can\t read the time. Sorry....^3.00

15^518^Five Stars^2016-01-22^false^ As expected, arrived on time^5.00
15^519^Five Stars^2016-01-17^false^ excellent^5.00
16^520^Pretty Good^2016-01-21^false^ Works great so far. I\ve used it to cut up cucumbers, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, and a few other things with both thick and thin blades. I haven\t had a problem with smushing tomatoes. It\s pretty easy to set up and use right out the box. I\ve had a few issues with uneven cuts but I\m pretty sure that it\s my fault since I hadn\t used one before. There are a couple reasons I took off one star. There\s no easy way to store this without keeping it in the box and even then it\s a pain to get everything to fit back in nicely. One of the pictures shows a nice way to situate everything to store but I haven\t gotten that to work yet. It would be nice if it had a bigger stand or something, slicing over a cutting mat can be kind of a pain. There is some waste with the way you use the slice and holder. I got a safety glove (which I would recommend anyway) and it\s reduced the waste a lot since I can hold that last piece and slide it myself. Overall, it\s a good purchase and would recommend.^4.00
16^521^She is learning to use it as its very sharp and can get cut pretty bad if not careful^2016-01-19^false^ I have one and use it a lot and got one for my daughter for Christmas. She is learning to use it as its very sharp and can get cut pretty bad if not careful. It comes with a guard that really must be used .^5.00
16^522^Excellent Quality^2016-01-18^false^ Very Nice, Very Sharp. I\ve had this Mandoline slicer for about 7 years. I use it all the time, and it still cuts as good as the day I bought it^5.00
16^523^THE BEST...^2016-01-18^false^ This thing is GREAT, the cost is unbeliveable, and it works GREAT, thin slices and I feel safe using it...^5.00
16^524^Great utensil for cutting veggies^2016-01-19^false^ I use it for everything.. It\s easy to clean and cuts almost all veggies in less than a minute^5.00
16^525^Excellent^2016-01-14^false^ Excellent product^5.00
16^526^Great^2016-01-21^false^ Great product.^5.00
16^527^V-slicer^2016-01-20^false^ This was a present for my daughter. I haven\t heard anything back about it so I don\t know how she likes it.^5.00
17^528^Good for maternity and beyond^2016-01-12^false^ This pillow, while not the greatest in aesthetic quality, is great! I agonized over buying a costly pillow I wasn\t sure would work but I\m so glad I did. It DOES come with a slipcover, sure it\s a bit flimsy but I\ve already removed it to wash it and it was fine. For people who turn a lot I can see that this might be cumbersome to start but I\ve adjusted easily to simply pulling my knees up and then rotating and putting them down again for an easy middle of the night turn. My favorite maternity purchase for sure and it\s already been useful when I babysat my niece (7mos) as a bumper on my bed to prevent rolling so I\m excite to keep using it after maternity as well.^4.00
17^529^love, love, love it!^2016-01-15^false^ Finally some relief! I bought this pillow while laying in my hospital bed for 11 days for a compression fracture of the spine due to a fall. I know that it seems that mostly pregnant women are using this pillow, and I can certainly understand why, but, it is also a wonderful alternative for people with pain. I also have fibromyalgia, bursitis of the shoulder and osteoarthritis of the hips, back and knees. Believe me, I know what pain is and now, due to this awesome pillow, I finally have some relief. I may just never want to get out of bed again!^5.00
17^530^This pillow saved my life^2016-01-18^false^ Being pregnant was great. Until the end of the second trimester. I didn\t even gain that much weight but the sheer size of my belly was just uncomfortable no matter what - until I laid on my left side in bed with my snoogle. My boyfriend quickly grew jealous of my pillow when I started to really rely heavily (pun intended) on it for cuddling at night instead of him. It held up to my weight and sweat (7 months pregnant in Florida in the summer) and I even took it with me to Disney world.^5.00
17^531^Awesome^2016-01-01^false^ My mom has sciatica and she absolutely loves this pillow. Granted she loves all pillows but this one is unlike her regular body is better because it\s nice and firm and actually gives her support. It comes with a sheet that gives you different ideas on how to use the pillow it\s very versatile with many uses. I have even seen her walking around her house with it wrapped around her body like a snake. When she got it her dog got jealous of it so I think that says something.^5.00
17^532^Perfect Bed Companion^2016-01-19^false^ My wife was really having a hard time getting comfortable at night during her pregnancy. So after a ton of research, we settled on this. We didn\t want something super massive, to the point that I would essentially be sleeping on the floor. This pillow is the perfect companion for our bed. It\s not to big, but yet, it hits all the comfort points. If you share a bed with someone and your bed is smaller than a queen, this probably isn\t the right pillow for you.^5.00
17^533^Purchased for my fiance which was great during the first month but product did not even ...^2016-01-16^false^ Purchased for my fiance which was great during the first month but product did not even last 7 months. By the time she was 8 months into her pregnancy, the pillow was no longer fluffy and did not retain its shape. In addition, the pillow cover was NOT comfortable at all. Had to tailor pillow covers with other fabric because the covers offered by Leachco were all rough, which made the skin itch.^2.00
17^534^Nice Body Pillow^2016-01-08^false^ The material is nice and is soft. My sister purchased this item when she was within her first trimester and she did not use it much. During maybe the middle of her second trimester is when she began to use the snoogle. She uses it at night when she goes to bed. The only down side to the Snoogle that my sister and brother-in-law can think is the pillow cover. Once you take it off it can be difficult to put back on because the opening to the pillow cover is only at one end. This means that you have to put the entire pillow cover back on from one end and pull the pillow through the cover all the way to the other end of the pillow. We thought it would be better if maybe a zipper was involved just because it would be easier to put the cover back on the pillow. Overall, it is still a very nice pillow.^4.00
17^535^at best it might just keep your back warm^2016-01-20^false^ My wife was not very impressed. It doesn\t really support your back, at best it might just keep your back warm. It is nice to have the pillow between the legs, but you don\t need a total body pillow for that. She didn\t like that she couldn\t use her regular pillow for her head when using this. It mostly just sits by the side of our bed.^3.00
17^536^Cover is too scratchy^2016-01-03^false^ This was my first pregnancy pillow purchase and I returned it for the jersey version. This version has a weird cover that is super scratchy and uncomfortable. The neck part was also diggy. I dont have any problems with the jersey version though so if you are looking pay the couple extra dollars and get the jersey chic version of this pillow!^2.00
17^537^but I am glad I did^2016-01-20^false^ I didn\t want to cave and get a pregnancy pillow because of the price, but I am glad I did. This pillow does not completely take away back pain while sleeping, but it does make sleeping a WHOLE lot more comfortable! I use it every night and even during the day if I lay down on the floor. Highly recommend!^5.00
17^538^Loved this product when I bought it last year when ...^2016-01-18^false^ Loved this product when I bought it last year when I had to buy a new one I was excited. Truly was an amazing product. However I\m not sure if something has changed with the stuffing or what but this pillow now gives me terrible headaches. I can\t use it at all. What a huge waste of $!^1.00
17^539^Great Pillow!^2015-12-17^false^ This pillow is completely worth it! I started sleeping with my snoogle when I was about 5-6 months pregnant, and found that I couldn\t sleep without it! Even my husband has commented on how comfortable it is! Definitely worth it!^5.00
17^540^Too hard and too big^2016-01-11^false^ Too hard and too big. I would love it if it will allow me to use my own pillow, but it\s too big and I have to use it as my pillow, but it is too hard and high for me, makes my neck stiff in the morning. I really hate it!^1.00
17^541^I thought I would love this but it takes up so much space it ...^2016-01-15^false^ I thought I would love this but it takes up so much space it is like having a third person in bed with us. I also think I may be a little tall for it (I am 6 feet tall) so it is hard to get comfortable.^4.00
17^542^A pregnancy must have!^2016-01-15^false^ Around 18 weeks I was started becoming uncomfortable while sleeping, and this helped tremendously! I suggest buying the jersey cover for it, the original cover is a bit rough feeling on your skin.^5.00
17^543^I love this pillow^2015-12-30^false^ I love this pillow. I have used it for two pregnancies and one major surgery. It\s a life saver especially with last trimester. Does need the jersey cover to make it really comfortable though.^5.00
17^544^Very comfortable!^2016-01-20^false^ Very comfortable and durable. I could sleep with it by hugging the pillow as well as using it as back support (if I want to roll over).^5.00
17^545^Great product at a great price^2016-01-20^false^ All I can say is I wish I had bought this item earlier! Really helped with my sleep issues!. Great product at a great price! Thanks!^5.00
17^546^Love!^2015-12-29^false^ Absolutely love it. I\m only in my first trimester and it really helps support my back. Without it, I can\t sleep on my side.^4.00

18^581^Great for a child\s nativity!^2016-01-18^false^ This is a fun product! I did confuse Joseph with one of the wisemen for a short period of time. Look for the one not holding anything. The noise is not to loud, and it doesn\t last long which is helpful. Any of the pieces fit on top which makes it even more fun for the children. It is very simple to assemble also. I got this for my niece and she loved it. Played with it for quite some time before getting distracted. She came back to this toy a lot through out the day. This is a great way for children to have a nativity that they can play with while parents have the untouchable kind.^5.00
18^582^Fun for the kids!^2016-01-21^false^ This was so perfect. With a 2 year old and a 4 year old, I needed something that they would be allowed to play with. I remember growing up and always wanting to play with the set my parents had. We were never allowed to touch our s and it was torture! LOL! This one is so cute and fun for the kids. The book that you can buy in addition to this is also great. My kids had a blast reenacting the book with the characters.^5.00
